#### Goal of the project
Create a desktop application (game) which will include all basics (or most of them) of object-oriented programming.
                          
#### Instruction  
Improve hero, explore the map, defeat the enemies, find the dragon's armor.

#### Notes
Someone might ask why I published here this console app from 2013 with poorly written code and justifiably so. But the answer is simple. 
By this application I realized, that I really like programming, especially when I can apply my own ideas.
